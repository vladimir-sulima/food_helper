# food_helper
My learning project.

Stack - python, flask, sqalchemy, Azure SQL PaaS

The initial functionality involves notifying family members of the need to purchase everyday food. Thus, users will always be able to timely replenish food supplies. 
Also, the application will remind users of the approaching expiration date of products. This option will help families make the most of their existing food stock. In turn, this will reduce the total monetary costs of the family, and also help people reduce the level of discarded products. 
During the development of this application, new features will be planned and added.
